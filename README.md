# A-Train-Station
Software Platform: The project was developed using HTML5 for webpage structure and JavaScript (ES6) as the primary programming language. Three.js, a high-level library, was utilized to render 3D graphics, leveraging WebGL as the underlying rendering API. Code was written and edited in Notepad++, while Google Chrome served as the testing and execution environment.

Project Features:

Continuous Train Movement:
The train moves smoothly from left to right across the station in a continuous loop. This is handled in the animation loop by updating the train’s x-position every frame. Once it reaches a target position, it resets to the starting point, creating an endless motion.

Keyboard-Controlled Camera:
The camera allows interactive scene exploration using arrow keys. Left/Right arrows rotate the camera around the station, while Up/Down arrows control zoom, letting users view the scene from multiple angles.

Train Headlight Toggle:
A point light attached to the train functions as a headlight. Clicking the mouse toggles this light on or off, demonstrating an interactive lighting effect within the 3D scene.

Extended Platform & Aligned Tracks:
The platform was lengthened for greater realism. Railway tracks were extended and aligned to match the platform’s width, creating a visually cohesive and well-structured station layout.

Responsive Window Resizing:
The scene dynamically updates its camera aspect ratio and renderer size when the browser window is resized. This ensures that the display remains visually accurate and proportioned across different screen sizes.
